<h2>The Walk</h2>
<p align="justify">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> An eight night (or fewer, if preferred) circular walking Holiday of the Cotswolds with shorter walking days.
<br /><br />
Leave any day you like subject to accommodation availability. ‘The Best of the Cotswolds’ walk includes all the finest villages of the northern Cotswolds in manageable stages for people who prefer shorter walking days. You can do the full 8 night itinerary or just a part of it, with the price adjusted accordingly. This tour is a good option for those after a less strenuous itinerary or who would like more time to explore some of the villages and to take their time on the walks.
<br /><br />
This journey takes you through some of the nicest countryside and villages in The Cotswolds. The route will take you through charming and pretty villages, complete with houses made from the honey coloured limestone of the local area. Away from the villages enjoy the carefully researched walking routes that guide you through classic English countryside. With green rolling hills of pasture and farmland, the area is full of history, some of which is evident to this day. Keep an eye out for sheep (and lambs in the spring/early summer) and enjoy your journey on to the next village as you admire the scenery along the way.

<article>
<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p align="justify">There are different categories of accommodation available from B&B accommodation to Village Inns to small & luxury hotels. Ensuite rooms are booked where possible, in some B&B's a private bathroom may be necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">B&B accommodation is generally in guesthouses, often private residences where some of the rooms are used for guests. They are also often smaller in size than Inns or hotels. All of our selected B&Bs will give you a warm welcome with a hearty breakfast for you in the morning. Because these are often private residences, there may not be the facilities you would expect to find in dedicated accommodation establishments. And they do not generally have options for dining in the evening.</p>
<p align="justify">Village Inns are generally larger, they may cater for only guests or they may also be a pub which also has guest rooms. They generally tend to have more in the way of facilities and have some kind of bar or dining options and are generally larger establishments than B&B’s</p>
<p align="justify">Hotels are usually the biggest of the establishments that we use and are more dedicated just to accommodation than B&B’s or Inns. There is a wide variety of hotels in The Cotswolds ranging from small hotels, to hotels with restaurants, to award winning luxury hotels.</p>
